This folder is used to embed game data files into the executable.


Any ".zip" files placed here will be embedded into the executable and can be referenced via
  `#include "embedded_files.h"`
...see APC_InitAssets (referencing BaseAssets.zip) in ap_basic.c for an example of this.


Any ".apworld" files here that are compatible with APDoom (are generated by ap_gen_tool) will
be available for play without any further work needed on the player's end.
